# Life-Index

Life-Index is a personal search engine based on [Norch](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/norch) and [Search-index](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/search-index), making my digital life searchable. Proof of concept.

Life-Index Will be a fork of [Norch-bootstrap](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/norch-bootstrap), and build on top of [Life-Indexer](https://github.com/eklem/life-indexer) and [iftt-norch-tools](https://github.com/eklem/iftt-norch-tools) for document processing and indexing.
