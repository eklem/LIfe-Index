# Life-Index

Life-Index is a personal search engine based on [Norch](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/norch) and [Search-index](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/search-index), making my digital life searchable. Proof of concept.

Life-Index is a forked version of [Norch-bootstrap](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/norch-bootstrap). It uses [iftt-norch-tools](https://github.com/eklem/iftt-norch-tools) for document processing and [Life-Indexer](https://github.com/eklem/life-indexer) for indexing.

The data comes from several IFTTT IF-recipes, storing it in several Google Drive Spreadsheets. Life-Indexer pulls this information from Google Drive and index it.
